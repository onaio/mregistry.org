    <h1>Why should you register?</h1>

<p>Submitting your mHealth solution into the mRegistry offers a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gain a registry ID that can be used by you, the mHealth community, and other organizations as a way to uniquely
        refer to your mHealth strategy or project.
    </li>
    <li>Gain a visual representation of your mHealth project or strategy that is helpful as a way to be able to
        articulate your approach to different stakeholders and across sectors
    </li>
    <li>Ensure that partner institutions which house additional information on specific deployments, institutions
        funding mHealth, and health journals are able to refer to the unique identifier.
    </li>
    <li>Ensure that WHO mTERG is able to catalogue the mHealth strategies utilized, and appropriately link project or
        strategy based evidence of value.
    </li>
</ul>
