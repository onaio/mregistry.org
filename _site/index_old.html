<P>
    The mRegistry.org is a collaboration between WHO mTERG(<a href="http://who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/mhealth/en/index.html">1</a>), UNICEF, JHU GmI, frog design, Ona Labs, WHO HRP and other partners and aims to be the definitive health registry for mHealth implementations and repository of mHealth strategies related to reproductive, maternal, and child health.
    <br><br>
    mRegistry.org provides a way for projects to submit descriptions of their mHealth approaches to the central mHealth Registry, from where a Unique ID will be issued. This unique ID will be linked by a variety of partner organizations as a unique reference to the specific mHealth implementation.
    <br><br>

    <b>mRegistry Components:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Standardized and systematic method for describing mHealth strategies using a shared taxonomy,</li>
    <li>Provision of a unique project identifier recognized by leading agencies, donors and partner institutions,</li>
    <li>Registration with WHO mHealth TERG for assessment as a mHealth strategy</li>
    <li>Consistency with the WHO / RHR mHealth Visual Framework [<a href="http://www.ghspjournal.org/content/1/2/160.full">2</a> ]</li>
    <li>Provision of diagram visually representing the specific mHealth implementation accessible online and offline.</li>
</ul>

This effort aims to address the recognized challenge among decision-makers, mHealth implementers and technologists to know where to go to find information about specific mHealth implementations, and the tools to be able to systematically and objectively describe mHealth strategies. It also provides mHealth projects with the ability to register and uniquely identify their implementations and strategies, so that International agencies are able to review and understand their role in addressing health system challenges and needs.
<br><br>
<b>Background</b>
<br><br>
The lack of a common tool to represent the diversity of mHealth approaches has hindered the articulation of these innovations to those in the mainstream health sector, limiting understanding and the potential for uptake. In order to describe what mHealth approaches do in relation to the needs of the health sector, this electronic tool enables registration of mHealth solutions (as generic strategies or geographically defined mHealth projects), and provision of a visual representation, following the standards of the WHO mTERG "mHealth and ICT Framework" (<a href="http://who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/mhealth/en/index.html">1</a>).
<br><br>
The mRegistry combined with the mHealth framework serves as a systematic way to uniquely identify, and describe mHealth project implementations. It enables developers as well as implementers to detail which of the mHealth strategies form the basis of their deployments, and visually depict where mHealth innovations interact in the health system. This electronic tool facilitates project descriptions using the specific components of the Framework, and provides a systematic process for representing any specific mHealth implementation and creating a visual representation based on the Framework.
<br><br>

Submitting your mHealth solution into the mRegistry offers a number of benefits:
<ul>
    <li>Gain a registry ID that can be used by you, the mHealth community, and other organizations as a way to uniquely refer to your mHealth strategy or project.</li>
    <li>Gain a visual representation of your mHealth project or strategy that is helpful as a way to be able to articulate your approach to different stakeholders and across sectors.</li>
    <li>Ensure that partner institutions which house additional information on specific deployments, institutions funding mHealth, and health journals are able to refer to the unique identifier.</li>
    <li>Ensure that WHO mTERG is able to catalogue the mHealth strategies utilized, and appropriately link project or strategy based evidence of value.</li>
</ul>
