    <h1>About the MRegistry</h1>

<p>The mRegistry.org is a collaboration between WHO mTERG(1), UNICEF, JHU GmI, frog design, Ona Labs, WHO HRP and
    other partners and aims to be the definitive health registry for mHealth implementations and repository of
    mHealth strategies related to reproductive, maternal, and child health.</p>

<p>mRegistry.org provides a way for projects to submit descriptions of their mHealth approaches to the central
    mHealth Registry, from where a Unique ID will be issued. This unique ID will be linked by a variety of partner
    organizations as a unique reference to the specific mHealth implementation.</p>

<h2>mRegistry Components</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Standardized and systematic method for describing mHealth strategies using a shared taxonomy,</li>
    <li>Provision of a unique project identifier recognized by leading agencies, donors and partner institutions,
    </li>
    <li>Registration with WHO mHealth TERG for assessment as a mHealth strategy</li>
    <li>Consistency with the WHO / RHR mHealth Visual Framework [2]</li>
    <li>Provision of diagram visually representing the specific mHealth implementation accessible online and offline
</ul>
</li>

<p>This effort aims to address the recognized challenge among decision-makers, mHealth implementers and
    technologists to know where to go to find information about specific mHealth implementations, and the tools to
    be able to systematically and objectively describe mHealth strategies. It also provides mHealth projects with
    the ability to register and uniquely identify their implementations and strategies, so that International
    agencies are able to review and understand their role in addressing health system challenges and needs.</p>

<p>The lack of a common tool to represent the diversity of mHealth approaches has hindered the articulation of these
    innovations to those in the mainstream health sector, limiting understanding and the potential for uptake. In
    order to describe what mHealth approaches do in relation to the needs of the health sector, this electronic tool
    enables registration of mHealth solutions (as generic strategies or geographically defined mHealth projects),
    and provision of a visual representation, following the standards of the WHO mTERG "mHealth and ICT Framework"
    (1).</p>

<p>The mRegistry combined with the mHealth framework serves as a systematic way to uniquely identify, and describe
    mHealth project implementations. It enables developers as well as implementers to detail which of the mHealth
    strategies form the basis of their deployments, and visually depict where mHealth innovations interact in the
    health system. This electronic tool facilitates project descriptions using the specific components of the
    Framework, and provides a systematic process for representing any specific mHealth implementation and creating a
    visual representation based on the Framework.</p>
