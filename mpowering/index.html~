<h3> Rapid Project Registry</h3>

The <a href="/">mRegistry</a> provides a way for projects to submit descriptions of their partner projects, contribute additional information that is relevant to mPowering Frontline Workers initiative, but also ensure alignment and submission to the central WHO mHealth Project Registry, from where a Unique ID will be issued.
<br><br>
The mHealth project form linked below will allow your project to quickly be entered into a processing queue for inclusion in the WHO Global Registry of mHealth Projects focusing on activities that leverage mobile and information / communications technologies and associated content to strengthen community and frontline health workers.
